    <h1>Math Tips!</h1>
    <p>Here are some interesting math facts and theories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pythagorean Theorem:</strong> In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. It's often expressed as: \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).</li>
        <li><strong>Prime Numbers:</strong> Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.</li>
        <li><strong>Fibonacci Sequence:</strong> The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.</li>
        <li><strong>Pi (Ï€):</strong> Pi is an irrational number representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Its decimal representation is infinite and non-repeating: 3.14159265359...</li>
        <li><strong>Euler's Identity:</strong> Euler's identity is a mathematical formula that relates five of the most important mathematical constants: \(e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\).</li>
    </ul>
